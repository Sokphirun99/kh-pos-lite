## 📁 Docker Files Created

I've created a comprehensive Docker setup:

- **`docker-compose.yml`** - Full production setup
- **`docker-compose.simple.yml`** - Services only (currently running)
- **`docker-compose.dev.yml`** - Development setup
- **`apps/Dockerfile`** - Flutter web build
- **`services/api/Dockerfile`** - Laravel API build
- **`docker/`** - Nginx configurations and utilities

## 🔧 Setup Scripts

- **`./hybrid-setup.sh`** - Run services in Docker, apps locally (recommended)
- **`./docker-setup.sh`** - Full Docker setup
- **`./dev-setup.sh`** - Local development only

## 📝 Notes

1. **Workmanager is disabled for web** - Background tasks don't work in web browsers
2. **Isar database regenerated** - Fixed JavaScript compatibility issues
3. **Migration order fixed** - `order_items` now runs after `orders` table creation
4. **Web support added** - Flutter project now supports web platform

## 🚨 If You Encounter Issues

### Flutter App Won't Start
```bash
cd apps
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if MySQL is running
docker ps | grep mysql

# Reset database
cd services/api
php artisan migrate:fresh
```

### Port Conflicts
Edit the ports in `docker-compose.simple.yml` if needed.
